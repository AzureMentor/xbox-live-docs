# Player Stats 2013

Player stats are key pieces of information to track about a player, such as *Head Shots* or *Fastest Lap Time*.

Stats are used to generate leaderboards in scenarios that allow players to compare their effort and skills with their friends and every other player in a title's community.

See [User Stats for Data Platform 2013](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/xbox/docs/xdk/user-stats).
