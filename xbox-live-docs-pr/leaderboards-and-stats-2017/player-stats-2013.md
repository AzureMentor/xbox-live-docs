# Player Stats 2013

Player stats are key pieces of information to track about a player, such as *Head Shots* or *Fastest Lap Time*.

Stats are used to generate leaderboards in scenarios that allow players to compare their effort and skills with their friends and every other player in a title's community.

With Player Stats 2013, the Xbox Live Service owns and maintains the stats; stats are updated based on your game sending user-action events to the Xbox Live Service.

Player Stats 2013 is for Managed Partners only.
