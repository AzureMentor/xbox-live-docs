# User Stats overview

<!-- 
From top of public "contrast" article "Using player stats".
Better or additional content could be from public: "Player Data: Stats, Leaderboards, and Achievements" 
-->

User Stats are key pieces of information used to track a playerâ€™s performance, such as *Head Shots* or *Fastest Lap Time*.

Stats are used to generate leaderboards in scenarios that allow players to compare their effort and skills with their friends and every other player in a title's community.

The Xbox Live service owns and maintains the stats; stats are updated based on your game sending user-action events to the Xbox Live service.


## Configured stats, shown in the leaderboard

*Configured stats* show up in a title's leaderboard, where a player will see how they rank against their friends who have also played the title.


## Featured stats (Hero stats), shown in Game Hub and Content Blocks

The stats that show up in a title's Game Hub are called *Featured stats*, or *Hero stats*.
