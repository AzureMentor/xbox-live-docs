# Onboarding flowchart

The following are the top-level steps to start adding Xbox Live functionality to your game, regardless of which Xbox Live developer program you join, which IDE you set up, and which platforms you target.

## The series of articles to follow

To start adding Xbox Live to your game, you follow a series of onboarding articles:

1. The article about choosing which Xbox Live developer program to join, and one of the articles about actually joining an Xbox Live developer program (to join either the Creators or ID@Xbox Managed Partners Program).

2. One of the articles about creating a new game app in Partner Center and noting its IDs - either as a Creator or as an ID@Xbox Managed Partner.

3. An article about setting up an IDE to use the Xbox Live SDK.
   <!-- There is a version of this article for each combination of IDE and target platform, for each developer program. -->

4. An article about adding basic sign-in code, for the game to sign-in to Xbox Live services.
   <!-- There are several versions of this article, based on which platform you target: Mobile (Android or iOS), Windows 10, and Xbox. -->

The end result of following this Xbox Live onboarding flow is that you have a single IDE set up to call the Xbox Services API from a single target platform, and your game running on that platform has done basic sign-in to Xbox Live.
Then your game is ready to add other Xbox Live features and call the Xbox Services API other than for basic sign-in.
