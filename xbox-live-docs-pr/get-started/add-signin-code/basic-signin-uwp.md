# Adding basic sign-in code for UWP

Adding basic sign-in code to your game enables the user to do basic sign-in to Xbox Live on the user's device.


## Prerequisites

Before adding code to your game to do basic sign-in into the Xbox Live services, you must do the following:

1. Create a new game app at Partner Center and note the game app's Title ID, SCID, Sandbox ID, and Client ID; see [Setting up a game app at Partner Center](../setup-partner-center/index.md).

2. Add the Xbox Live SDK to an IDE that targets UWP; see [Setting up an IDE to use Xbox Live](../setup-ide/index.md).



## Initialize

Set up your project to call the Xbox Live sign-in API, as described below.

TBD


## Basic Sign-In/Sign-Out


### Sign-In Silently


### Sign-In with UI


### Sign-Out


## Cleanup


## Testing basic sign-in


## Next step

Now that your game enables the user to do basic sign-in to Xbox Live on the device, you are ready to implement any of the Xbox Live features, which are provided through the Xbox Services API (XSAPI).
See [Features](../../features/index.md).
